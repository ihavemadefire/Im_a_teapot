# ðŸ«– Teapot API

**HTTP 418: Because Joey asked.**

This is an extremely serious production-grade API that does one thing and one thing only:  
It tells the truth.

## What does it do?

It tells you that it's a teapot.  
Not a coffee machine. Not a microwave. A **teapot**.

## Why?

Because one day, a mysterious figure named **Joey** whispered:  
> "Make the internet a little weirder."  

This is our offering.

## How to Run It

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn teapot_api:app --reload
